# openjscad-dual-angle
Simple OpenJSCAD script to help visualize bowling ball layouts using the Dual Angle system

Goto http://openjscad.xyz/ and drag/drop the V2 script into the upload box.  
There are some pan/move instructions in the left pane, and you can hide the source with the little slider control.

Enter your layout/release params and hit Update.  That's about it.  

I have very little time invested in this, but was looking for something to do some parametric modeling.
Perhaps somebody else will find it useful, and it may evolve over time.

Note: The rendering performance in the browser is pretty slow.  
OpenSCAD (native app) is much faster, but definitely less convenient - and the programming environment is very limited.
